## Margin & Padding Shorthand

```css
margin: [top] [right] [bottom] [left];
```

If you specify only one value, it will be applied to all four sides of the element (top, right, bottom, and left).
```css
/* All margins are 10 pixels */
margin: 10px;
```


If you provide two values, the first one will be applied to the top and bottom, and the second one will be applied to the right and left.
```css
/* Top and bottom margins are 20 pixels, right and left margins are 30 pixels */
margin: 20px 30px;
```


If you provide three values, the first one will be applied to the top, the second one to the right and left, and the third one to the bottom.
```css
/* Top margin is 5 pixels, right and left margins are 15 pixels, bottom margin is 10 pixels */
margin: 5px 15px 10px;
```
