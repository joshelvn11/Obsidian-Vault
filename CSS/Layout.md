## Block Elements

Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent element unless overridden by a `max-height` or `max-width` property.

## Inline Elements

Inline elements take up as much space as their contents and cannot have `width` or `height` properties set.

## Inline Block Elements

Inline-block elements are created by setting the value of the `display` property to `inline-block`. They are similar to inline elements because they are the same size as their content, and we can place them next to each other and other inline elements. However, unlike inline elements, they can have size properties. In this way, they are similar to block-level elements. When setting the size properties, there is a nice difference between inline-block and block-level elements. Inline-block elements will not exceed the number set by the `width` or `height` properties, while block-level elements will stretch as wide as possible.
