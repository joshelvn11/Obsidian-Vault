### Git Commit Message Prefixing Conventions
feat for feature, fix for a bugfix, style for changes to your CSS, docs for changes related to documentation, refactor for refactored code or maint for general maintenance.

So, the above example would look like this: fix: Make heroImage.jpg in index.html responsive. If you were updating your README file, you could have a commit message like this: docs: Add testing & deployment sections to README.

### Setup
Configuring user information used across all local repositories.

set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history
```
git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]” 
```


set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
```
git config --global user.email “[valid-email]
```
