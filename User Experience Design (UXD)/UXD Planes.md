## 3. The Structure Plane
The structure plane is concerned with organisation of your functionality and content and how to navigate in an intuitive way through your content and features.

There are always many different ways to structure your content, be sure to choose a way that is most appropriate for your intended audience and their culture.

Questions that may be asked at the structure plane:
1. How do you get to a particular point of information?
2. Where can you go from there?
3. What are the categories of information?

The Structure Pane addresses:
1. The way information is presented
2. How the information is organised
3. That the overall interaction is intuitive

### Interaction Design (IXD)
IXD is concerned with defining the structure and behaviour of interactive systems. It creates meaningful relationships between the content and communicates functionality and interactivity.

IXD also accomplishes the following, it:
1. Reveals workflows
2. Reduces risk of user error
3. Makes users aware of state changes

IXD can be broken down into five concerns:
1. Consistent
2. Predictable
3. Learnable
4. Visible
5. Provides clear and intuitive feedback 

If a user can answer Yes to the following questions then you've provided a strong sense of place:
1. Where am I?
2. How did I get here?
3. What can I do here?
4. Where I can from here?

### Information Architecture (IA)
IA is responsible for the creation of organisational and navigational schemas. It allows users to efficiently move through content. Good Information Architecture can accommodate growth and change over time. 

Types of Information Architecture:
#### Hierarchical Tree Structure
Standard structure that reduces complexity by revealing information and structure as you navigate down and up through the tree. 

If a user needs to use more than three clicks to navigate to their required location your structure is probably too complex.

#### Nested List
The nested list is a linear path to details and reduces complexity but because it's a very defined path to the location it can prevent exploring. It is often better suited to mobile devices

#### Hub & Spoke
Central home with links to spokes of information. It works well for multi-feature apps but you can't navigate between spokes, you must come back to the home to move to another spoke.

#### Dashboard
The dashboard structure is very useful for at a glance key information. The primary elements on the dashboard can be expanded to show details of that information. Dashboards in general are more suited to desktop applications.

### Principles of Organisation
There is often and organising principle behind how information is organised, see the below diagram.

The organising principles used at the highest levels of the site should be the most closely tied to user needs and business objectives. Those used at lower levels are usually influences by feature specs and content requirements.

# 4. The Skeleton Plane

The skeleton plane in concerned with navigation design and interface design.

The skeleton plane is concerned with the following questions:
- What form will the application take?
- How will users get around?
- How will we present the content?

To give form to function we need to:
- Rapidly establish value in the users mind
